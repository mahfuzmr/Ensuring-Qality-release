## Introduction
To ensure quality release our target is to ensure release that are filly automated from development till testing. Each of the testing phase contains full automated testing on different environment. And when the deployment meets all the requiremnts then the CI/CD will deploy the autometically ot the corresponding app service.
In this demo project this process has been demonestratd: through following system diagram.

## Initial configuration
Before using Infarstructure as code provisioning we need to create 
* Login to azure account
* Resource group
* Storage account
* container
* connection access_key

### Configuration

    1. First, we have to ensure we are logged in into Azure CLI 
        Command:
        ```Bash
        az login
        ```
    2. Once that's done, we run the ```config.sh``` file. 
        Command:
        ```Bash
            sh terraformconfig.sh
        ```
    3. Following output we need to save
        - storage_account_name
        - container_name 
        - access_key
    4. As per project requirement we are creating directory In the ```main.tf``` in the ```environments\test``` .
    5. Replace the gaind out put 

        ```Bash
        terraform {
            backend "azurerm" {
                storage_account_name = ""
                container_name       = ""
                key                  = ""
                access_key           = ""
            }
        }
        ```
    6. Create a service principle.
        Command:
            ```Bash
                az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/your-subscription-id"
            ```
        
            We will get an output similar to this:
            ```Bash
            {
            "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
            "name": "xxxxxxxxx-cfbe-4f86-947e-000000000000",
            "password": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "tenant": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
            ```
            Where - appId is the client_id, password is the client_secret, tenant is the tenant_id.

            Replace each value into ```terraform.tfvars```
## Resource Creation
Before running the pipeline make sure to install the Terraform extension [Azure Pipelines Terraform Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charleszipp.azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform&targetId=b71721d4-0e92-4bfc-a8fa-9444513a18ad&utm_source=vstsproduct&utm_medium=ExtHubManageList)

Now run the pipeline to execute above configuration and create resources. A successful pipeline provision, build deploy will look like:

Terraform provissioning

![Provision](screenshot/provision.png)

After execution terraform now it the build stage.

![Provision-Build](screenshot/Build.png)

Now its time to deploy FakerAPI to our application service

![Provision-Build](screenshot/deploy.png)

After deployment created resource can be shown in the azure portal Home > Resource group > Resource Visualizer :

![Provision-Build-Deploy](screenshot/resource-visualizer.png)

Our system is now ready for integrading test phase.


## Integrade Test suites through IaC
After implementing code for each of the test suites in the ``` azure-pipelines.yml ´´´ 

We can save and after succesfull execution the output of the test will be as follows:

![Provision-Build-Deploy-Test](screenshot/test.png)

Sometime because of the resource limit reached. [![WUPff](https://github.com/Iggy-Codes/logo-images/blob/master/logos/pug.png)] the integration test showing 429 Error that's why the test stage has warning sign. We can easity skip the error 429 if we want.


If the test phase succeed, the complete pipeline will show following output

![Provision-Build-Deploy-Test](screenshot/successful-run.png)

Azure pipeline build results can be shown as:

![Build Result](screenshot/build_result.png)

## Testing phases

We run 3 different test stage consists of three different steps:
* [Jmeter Tests](#integration-test)
* [Postman Tests](#performance-tests)
* [Selenium UI Tests](#ui-tests)

Each of the tests are done on the given demo application (App url are given insite the script). those are :
1. https://www.saucedemo.com/ (demo shoping site for UI Test)
2. https://dummy.restapiexample.com/ (demo API for Postman testing)
3.  https://p3testapp-appservice.azurewebsites.net (for our own app service performance test using JMeter)

### Jmeter Tests

After execution of the pipeline job for Jmeter Test suite following is the output:

 ![JMeter Test report pipeline steress](screenshot/output-stress.png)

  ![JMeter Test report pipeline endurance](screenshot/output-endurance.png)

After successfully test execution of JMeter for endurance and stress test locally the following are the output reports:

* Endurance test report

 ![Endurance Test report](screenshot/endurance-test-report.png)

* Stress test report

 ![Stress Test Report](screenshot/stress-test-report.png)

### Postman Tests
After execution of the pipeline job for Postman Test suite following is the output:

![Postman test report pipeline](screenshot/Postmantest.png)

* regression test result
![Regression test](screenshot/postman_summary.png)

* Validation tets rsult
![Validation](screenshot/validationsummery.png)

* Test result summery
![Test summery](screenshot/test-result-summery.png)

## Selenium UI Tests

After execution of the pipeline job for Selenium test suite following is the output:

![Selenium UI test pipeline](screenshot/Seleniumtest.png)

Output window of the selenium with Which user looged in, How many product added then remove.

![Pipeline output](screenshot/output-selenium.png)

## Monitoring
### Alert
After configuring action group in azure portal for out apservice we got following email

![Alert registration](screenshot/email-alert-initial.png)

And then when out alert triggered we get following email as warning (since out alert template was warning)

![Alert Triggered](screenshot/404%20alert.png)

Azure Log Analytics Workspace is the provider of the log monitoring. After configuring log Analytics. 

We can now query to see out log analytics
